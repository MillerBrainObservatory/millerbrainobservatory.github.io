# Glossary

```{glossary}

region-of-interest
  A set of 1 or more 2D planes which are stitched together to form the full image.

num_pixel_xy
  The number of pixels [X, Y] in each {term}`region-of-interest`.

roi_width_px
  The size of the {term}`region-of-interest` on its shortest dimension.

roi_height_px
  The size of the {term}`region-of-interest` on its longest dimension.

Field-of-view
  The total size (um) of the raw stitched image with no trimming operations.

image-length
  The number of pixels on the long axis of the raw {code}`.tiff` file.

image-width
  The number of pixels on the short, slow-galvo axis of the raw {code}`.tiff` file.

pixel-resolution
  The size, in micron, of each pixel.

skewness 
  How often do you get an outlier in the pixel activity across time, good for calcium indicators because theyre flat relative to a few events over the course of a recording. 

mean_img
  The average of the registered movie over time. Used as a baseline representation of the structural signal.

max_proj
  The maximum value per pixel over time. Highlights regions with high fluorescence, useful for detecting active areas.

meanImgE
  Enhanced mean image generated by Suite2p using filtering and sharpening operations. Useful for anatomical segmentation when available.

anatomical segmentation
  ROI detection based solely on static images (e.g. mean or max projection), ignoring fluorescence time dynamics.

functional segmentation
  ROI detection based on pixelwise correlations across time, identifying spatially contiguous regions with similar activity patterns.

seed
  A pixel or region in the image used as the **starting point** for growing a potential ROI.
  Seeding is based on high-intensity regions in the filtered image, and forms the initial guess
  for the shape and location of a neuron.

Delta F over F0
    $\Delta F / F_0$ (Delta F over F naught) refers to the fractional change in fluorescence relative to a baseline signal Fâ‚€.
    This is a common normalization used in calcium imaging and neural activity recordings.

segmentation
  The general process of dividing an image based on the contents of that image, in our case, based on neuron location.

source-extraction
  Umbrella term for all of the individual processes that produce a segmented image.

deconvolution
  The process performed after segmentation to the resulting traces to infer spike times from flourescence values.

Rigid-registration
  The object retains shape and size.

Non-rigid-registration
  The object is moved and transforms shape or size.

pixel-resolution
  The length of each pixel, in micron (px/um).
