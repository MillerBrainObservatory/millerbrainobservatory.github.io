Adding Docs
##############

TODO: A quick document to reference for somebody wanting to add a quick document
page to this repository. I think this will work the best if it is **as easy as humanly possible**
to add a new page/section/whatever needs to be added to these docs.

Also TODO: Im a little inconsistent with document titles and subtitles with using # vs * and =.

This is the convention used for Python docs:

Title
=====

Titles are underlined (or over- and underlined) with
a nonalphanumeric character at least as long as the
text.

A lone top-level section is lifted up to be the
document's title.

Any non-alphanumeric character can be used, but
Python convention is:

* ``#`` with overline, for parts
* ``*`` with overline, for chapters
* ``=``, for sections
* ``-``, for subsections
* ``^``, for subsubsections
* ``"``, for paragraphs
