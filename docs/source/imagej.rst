Visualize Data with ImageJ
=============================

Fiji is a version of ImageJ with "batteries included". To us, this includes several HDF5/Bioformat libraries that will help load our `.tiff` files.

Download Fiji for your platform `here <https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads>`_.

Although our data is in `.tiff` format, loading it in ImageJ may seem abnormal because ImageJ has no knowledge of the dimensionality of our dataset.
