Adding Docs
##############

TODO: A quick document to reference for somebody wanting to add a quick document
page to this repository.

This is the convention used for Python docs:

Title
=====

Titles are underlined (or over- and underlined) with
a nonalphanumeric character at least as long as the
text.

A lone top-level section is lifted up to be the
document's title.

Any non-alphanumeric character can be used, but
Python convention is:

* ``#``, for title
* ``=``, for sections
* ``-``, for subsections
* ``^``, for subsubsections
* ``"``, for paragraphs
